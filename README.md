# Repository for Labs
## CMPSC 441 and GAME 450

This repository will contain code for all the lab sessions for the course. New folders will be added to 'src' folder with the name of the lab. 

Abstract (250 words)
This repository contains all of the labs that we have done throughout the semseter, and includes the final project as well. The code is a game using Pygame where the player navigates between cities that are equally spread apart, and the player comes accross many enemy agents along the way. The game consists of multiple classes that define the behavior and attributes of various game entities. The PyGameHumanPlayer and PyGameHumanCombatPlayer classes allow the game to be played through a Pygame interface, where users to use keyboard input to make selections for their player. The selectAction and weapon_selecting_strategy methods are called during each round of the game to allow the player to choose their destination and their weapon of choice.
